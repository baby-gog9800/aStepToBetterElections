# aStepToBetterElections
AN OVERVIEW :
An idea to change voting system and targeting small percentage of indians not at their homeplaces.
Building an system or platform where people could vote online securely. We are currently focusing on people who are not staying at their homeplaces.
By googling we have found certain problems with online elections.

Q => Why is online election a problem ?

A => 1. Theft of credential-it can be caused by phishing attempts or malware installed on the
system. Also malware attacks from users pc can be troublesome. Malware can prevent voting
by compromising or disrupting e-poll books or by disabling vote-casting systems. It can prevent
correct tallying by altering or destroying electronic records or by causing software to miscount
electronic ballots or physical ballots (e.g., in instances where optical scanners are used in the
vote tabulation process). Malware can also be used to disrupt auditing software. Other attacks -
There are other avenues through which electronic systems may be disrupted. Malicious actors
may obtain sensitive information such as user-names or passwords by pretending to be a
trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Servers may be breached to obtain
administrator-level credentials. Individuals with site access (e.g., employees or contractors)
might physically access a system.

2. In case of any fraud, it will be undetected.

3. Proxy Transactions - one can vote for other or could force others to vote,etc.

4. Not SECURE..!! All the hackers on the earth could access the vote database, could play
around with the votes casted. Here hacker could do a DDOS attack hence increasing the traffic
on the server/ application. Any script kiddie with some bitcoin can rent a botnet army of
compromised IoT devices and overwhelm the voting server on election day. To prevent such
attacks, companies typically use distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation services like
Cloudflare or Imperva Incapsula.Such services are suitable for many Silicon Valley-style
applications, but are unsuitable for ensuring a free and open democratic election. A DDoS
mitigation service has to spy on traffic in order to stop DDoS attacks. That means it has to
decrypt all traffic between the user and server to determine which traffic is good and which
traffic is bad. To do so, it acts as a transport layer security (TLS) proxy and performs a
"man-in-the-middle" attack — with permission, of course — against all traffic aimed at the online
voting service it's been hired to defend.
The use of a DDoS mitigation provider in an online election may prevent DDoS attacks that take
the voting website offline, but it creates a giant target with a big red bulls-eye for any
nation-state wanting to spy on voters or change their votes.

5. There is no transparency for online votings. It is said "People's vote is completely secret... It's
fully encrypted and safeguarded, it can't be tampered with." Also the transparency about howelections process works must be provided to voters.

6. All digital information—such as ballot definitions, voter choice records, vote tallies, or voter
registration lists—is subject to malicious alteration;
there is no technical mechanism currently available that can ensure that a computer
application—such as the one used to record or count votes—will produce accurate results;
testing alone cannot ensure that systems have not been compromised; and
any computer system used for elections—such as a voting machine or e-poll book—can be
rendered inoperable.

7. Three requirements for robust political elections: security, anonymity and verifiability. These
need to be provided efficiently to voters. 

These are the problems which are to be solved till best of our thinking and technolgy we have or known to us. All these 7 problems will be tackled in our solution. We thought of using already existing technolgies as well as will implement those in innovative ways so that our purpose of maximum security, privacy, antihacks, etc. could be achieved successfully.
Our technology would eventually help in early calculation of votes. Also this platform can replace the voting booths, and could serve both for people being at their hometowns and for those who aren't.



A BRIEF FUNCTIONALITY:
In our Platform, authorisation could be done using ADHAAR, one time login for mere 5 mins, OTP or other security measures, Generating an virtual id for voter, Voter is eligible to vote once, Vote is just counted no track of whom he voted, But full track of every log of website which will help to revese engineer any of the hacks if done, Accounts will be locked as soon as pereson votes none can access neither admin, data to be server secured (TLS and its enhancements applied innovatively), data stored in highle encrypted format, and other features promoting antihack, highly secure and privacy.

Other section of the Platform will contain the information like good deeds or the criminal records of all the candidates contesting for elections f users constituency
